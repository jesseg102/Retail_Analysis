# Retail Database Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a MySQL database to manage retail data, including customer information, transaction details, product information, logistics, and feedback.

## Prerequisites

- MySQL Server installed on local machine
- Python installed with the following libraries:
  - pandas
  - SQLAlchemy
  - PyMySQL

## Steps

### 1. Database Creation

1. **Create a Database**: 
   - Open  MySQL client.
   - Create new database named `retail_database`.

### 2. Table Setup

1. **Define Tables**:
   - Create the following tables within the `retail_database`:
     - `customer_info`: Customer details such as name, email, phone, address, and demographics.
     - `transactions_details`: Information about transactions, including transaction ID, customer ID, date, and amounts.
     - `transaction_logistics`: Details about shipping and payment methods.
     - `product_info`: Information about products, including product ID, category, brand, and type.
     - `feedback`: Customer feedback and ratings for products.

### 3. Data Preparation

1. **Prepare CSV Files**:
   - Clean and format the data to match the table schemas, especially we need to pay attention to date formats and data types.

### 4. Data Insertion

1. **Insert Data Using Python**:
   - Read the CSV files into pandas DataFrames.
   - Convert data formats 
   - Use SQLAlchemy to connect to the MySQL database and insert the data into the respective tables.

### 5. Data Verification

1. **Data**:
   - Run SQL queries to ensure that the data has been inserted correctly:
     - List all tables in the database.
     - Retrieve sample data from each table to ensure it matches the expected structure and content.
     - Check foreign key relationships to confirm data integrity.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, it will be a fully functional retail database set up with correctly inserted and verified data. This setup can now be used for further analysis, reporting, and application development related to retail management.
